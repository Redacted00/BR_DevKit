# Brick Rigs Unofficial SDK

## 4GB of happiness

***THIS BR SDK BRANCH IS VERY UNSTABLE***

*NOBODY KNOWS POTENTIAL OF THIS BRANCH*

This branch has every single Brick Rigs C++ file and it took a lot of time just to run it.
If you have any questions ask **kotofyt** or **redactedxd** in Discord

If you want to merge BR SDK and "4GB of happiness" just copy Content folder from BR SDK into '4GB of hapiness"
